<h3><span>Software Engineer, Charles Schwab</span> <span>March 2023 &ndash; Present</span></h3>
<p>Software engineer working on migrating applications to the cloud, quality assurance testing, writing
developing tools for support teams, and working on the build and deploy system. </p>
<ul>
<li>Worked on migrating the first application at the company to the cloud by writing K8s manifests in YAML and creating a CI/CD pipeline in Bamboo and Harness for deploying containers to K8s. I fully support this environment. </li>
<li>Upgraded insecure software on over 430 servers by writing an application that scrapes servers for information and performs specific upgrades based on findings.  </li>
<li>Provisioned over 300 servers in the cloud environments and assisted development teams of over 20 applications in setting up development and QA environments. </li>
<li>Wrote a REST API in Python with Flask that was used as a QA tool that 3 development teams used to verify the data integrity of their applications when migrated to the cloud.</li>
<li>Created a support environment, following cyber security principles, with Ansible and Python that support teams could use to troubleshoot and perform mass operations on an infrastructure of over 800 servers. </li>
<li>Tested 3 separate application networks by writing an application that performs multicast testing. This application was used by multiple other teams.</li>
<li>Performance tested an application that used gRPC protocol by assisting in writing a layer for an application that could facilitate a performance test. The data was then displayed on Grafana and Prometheus. </li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Software Engineer, Keysight Technologies</span><span>January 2022 &ndash; March 2023</span></h3>
<p>Worked on factory test systems in the production department, as a software engineer serving as the team DevOps CI/CD 
expert and leader. I had an impact by streamlining the 
build and deployment of testing software for factory products as well as supporting Linux servers used to support factory applications. </p>
<ul>
<li>Supported over 80 applications in their build and deploy cycle. Applications included 
Nuget packages, Chocolatey packages, NodeJS, and Python apps.</li>
<li>Performed a major upgrade to the Jenkins build system, upgrading all vulnerable plugins and the Jenkins software, while maintaining backward compatibility. 
This initiative involved creating a full-scale testing environment that modeled the CI/CD pipeline used in production.  </li>
<li>Created a new Jenkins  CI/CD system from scratch for another team.</li>
<li>Wrote CasC as Ansible scripts for provisioning build servers used by the Jenkins build system.</li>
<li>Built a new debug symbol server which became the new company standard. It utilized Artifactory as well as involved an upgrade to the company-wide build pipeline code, that was used by over 50 engineers
on over 10 teams. </li>
<li>Supported 85 Linux servers across 20+ sites worldwide which ran applications for testing in factories that were responsible for generating $ 1 billion/year.</li>
<li>Created a testing environment in AWS to model a subset of the Linux servers we managed in an effort as a part of our upgrade effort. </li>
</ul>
