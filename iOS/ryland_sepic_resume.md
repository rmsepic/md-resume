### <span>Software Engineer, Charles Schwab</span> <span>March 2023 -- Present</span>

* Migrated the first application at the company to the cloud by writing 
K8s manifests in YAML and creating a CI/CD pipeline in Bamboo and 
Harness for deploying containers to K8s. I fully support this 
environment. 
* Upgraded insecure software on over 430 servers by writing an application that scrapes servers for information and performs specific upgrades based on findings.  
* Provisioned over 300 servers in the cloud environments and assisted development teams of over 20 applications in setting up development and QA environments. 
* Wrote a REST API in Python with Flask that was used as a QA tool that 3 development teams used to verify the data integrity of their applications when migrated to the cloud.
* Created a support environment, following cyber security principles, with Ansible and Python that support teams could use to troubleshoot and perform mass operations on an infrastructure of over 800 servers. 
* Tested 3 separate application networks by writing an application that performs multicast testing. This application was used by multiple other teams.
* Performance tested an application that used gRPC protocol by assisting in writing a layer for an application that could facilitate a performance test. The data was then displayed on Grafana and Prometheus. 

### <span>Software Engineer, Keysight Technologies</span><span>January 2022 -- March 2023</span>

* Served as the team DevOps CI/CD expert and leader, supporting over 80 applications including Nuget pacakges, 
Chocolatey packages, NodeJS and Python apps.
* Performed a major upgrade to the Jenkins build system, upgrading all vulnerable plugins and primary Jenkins software, 
while still maintaining backwards compatibility. 
This initiative involved creating a full scale testing environment which modeled the CI/CD pipeline 
used in production.  
* Created a new Jenkins server to support a special CI/CD pipeline for another team.
* Wrote CasC as Ansible scripts for provisioning build servers used by the Jenkins.
* Built a debug symbol server which became the company standard. 
Utilized Artifactory and upgraded the company wide build pipeline code, 
that was used by over 500 engineers on over 50 teams. 
* Supported 85 Linux servers accross 20+ sites worldwide which ran applications 
for testing in factories that were responsible for generating $1billion/year.
* Created a testing and QA environment in AWS to model factory servers to test 
upgrades.
