hand -->
### <span>Software Engineer, Charles Schwab</span> <span>March 2023 -- Present</span>

* Created the build and deploy process for shipping containers to Kubernetes clusters. This process
involved containerizing applications, setting up a K8s cluster, and creating the build and deploy 
plans in Bamboo and Harness. I fully supported this environment afterwards. 
* Upgraded insecure software on over 430 servers by writing a Python application that could scrape servers for information 
and perform specific upgrades based on the findings.  
* Setup over 300 servers for over 20 development team's development and QA environments.
* Performed Quality Assurance testing on 3 applications for cloud migration by writing a Flask REST API app. 
* Created a support environment, following cyber security principles, 
with Ansible and Python that support teams used to troubleshoot and 
perform mass troubleshooting operations on infrastructure that contained over 800 servers. 
* Wrote an application for multicast testing in Python, used to test networks on 3 separate application architectures. 

### <span>Software Engineer, Keysight Technologies</span><span>January 2022 -- March 2023</span>

* Served as the team DevOps CI/CD expert and leader, supporting over 80 applications including Nuget pacakges, 
Chocolatey packages, NodeJS and Python apps.
* Performed a major upgrade to the Jenkins build system, upgrading all vulnerable plugins and primary Jenkins software, 
while still maintaining backwards compatibility. 
This initiative involved creating a full scale testing environment which modeled the CI/CD pipeline 
used in production.  
* Created a new Jenkins server to support a special CI/CD pipeline for another team.
* Wrote CasC as Ansible scripts for provisioning build servers used by the Jenkins.
* Built a new debug symbol server which became the new company standard. It utilized Artifactory as well
as involved an upgrade to the company wide build pipeline code, that was used by over 100 engineers
on over 25 teams. 
* Supported 85 Linux servers accross 20+ sites worldwide which ran applications 
for testing in factories that were responsible for generating $1billion/year.
* Created a testing environment in AWS to model a subset of the Linux servers we
managed in an effort as a part of our upgrade effort.
